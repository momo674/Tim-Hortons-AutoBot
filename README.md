# CRX-Project
Hello all!
This is my first ever big project I will be making on Python!

My goal is to be able to be in the area of my university campus and have a Twitter bot automatically send me a tweet to ask if I want to have an order placed at the local Tim Hortons.

Why would you even make this... its so extra...

Well it's because I really hate the long lines and I always forget to order my stuff in advanced too, plus I wanna get my hands on some api Work!
I first plan to make this project work for my own personal needs then I want to alter my work to allow anyone to use it!

Change Log:

2022-11-11:
- Created script to track location of my iphone using an api called pyicloud.
-The coordinates of my iphone will be detected once I run the script

HELLO ALL IT HAS BEEN A WHILE!
I have been studying very hard on my exams and I haven't had the time to really work on my project. However, I have been slowly revamping the project and the plan I have should be fully completed over my winter break! I'm revamping everything after brainstorming very hard for a long time!

I have been stuck for a while on what to do with the coordinate I was able to get from my location tracker.
I then did the following:
  - I created a custom map on Google Maps that is the area where I would like my program to be executed
  - I then created a function that takes the point from the iPhone location tracker (or any point as a parameter) 
  - if the function returns true, then the main Tim Hortons autobot script will execute.
